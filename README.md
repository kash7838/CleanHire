1. Problem Statement
Job seekers today face a broken hiring experience. Platforms like Naukri, LinkedIn, and others allow
companies to post jobs with minimal accountability. This leads to:

1. Poorly written or misleading job descriptions.
2. Unrealistic or bloated requirements.
3. Lack of transparency about company type (startup vs established).
4. Recruiters ghosting candidates after interviews.
5. No visibility into response timelines.
6. No mechanism for candidates to rate recruiter professionalism.
7. No standardized classification of job levels.

As a result, candidates feel frustrated, demotivated, and uncertain about the hiring process or delay results.

There is a clear need for a platform that enforces recruiter accountability, clarity, and transparency.

2. Product Vision
To create the world’s most transparent, candidate‑centric job platform where clarity, accountability, and
fairness are built into the hiring process.

ClearHire ensures that job posters follow structured guidelines, provide accurate information, and maintain
professional communication — ultimately improving trust and outcomes for candidates.
